- Branch from `main`: `feature/<short-topic>`
- Keep PRs focused; include screenshots of visual changes.

## Content Rules
- Keep tone: absurdist, family-friendly, heart-forward.
- Maintain character consistency; use the README tables.
- Scenes should default to third-person and aim for 1,000â€“2,000 words.

## Assets
- Put character refs in `assets/characters/`.
- Covers/posters in `assets/covers/`.
- Scene illustrations in `assets/scenes/`.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `emi-wooden-sword.png`).
